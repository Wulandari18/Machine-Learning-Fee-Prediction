# Machine-Learning-Fee-Prediction

In 2020, I joined Bootcamp about Python-Data Science which is held by Sanbercode. In the last project, I try to predict employee fees using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm of Machine Learning. 

To run the code we need the following packages:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn

Please contact me at wulanddarii18@gmail.com if any discussion about this code. 

Enjoy it!
